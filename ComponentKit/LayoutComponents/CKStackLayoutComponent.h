/**
 A simple layout component that stacks a list of children vertically or horizontally.

 - All children are initially laid out with the an infinite available size in the stacking direction.
 - In the other direction, this component's constraint is passed.
 - The children's sizes are summed in the stacking direction.
   - If this sum is less than this component's minimum size in stacking direction, children with flexGrow are flexed.
   - If it is greater than this component's maximum size in the stacking direction, children with flexShrink are flexed.
   - If, even after flexing, the sum is still greater than this component's maximum size in the stacking direction,
     justifyContent determines how children are laid out.

 For example:
 - Suppose stacking direction is Vertical, min-width=100, max-width=300, min-height=200, max-height=500.
 - All children are laid out with min-width=100, max-width=300, min-height=0, max-height=INFINITY.
 - If the sum of the childrens' heights is less than 200, components with flexGrow are flexed larger.
 - If the sum of the childrens' heights is greater than 500, components with flexShrink are flexed smaller.
   Each component is shrunk by `((sum of heights) - 500)/(number of components)`.
 - If the sum of the childrens' heights is greater than 500 even after flexShrink-able components are flexed,
   justifyContent determines how children are laid out.
