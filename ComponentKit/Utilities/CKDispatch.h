/**
 * This method dispatches a block on the main thread only when the

 *
 * Implementation Details:
 * The user is not interacting with the app when the main run loop has a run
 * mode that is NOT UITrackingRunLoopMode. This is implemented by dispatching
 * the block when the run mode of the main run loop is kCFRunLoopDefaultMode.
