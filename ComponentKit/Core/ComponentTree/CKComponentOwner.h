/**
 This protocol defines how a component behaves when the component tree is being constructed by infrastructure:
 'buildComponentTree:previousOwner:scopeRootstateUpdates'.

 Each component has a corsponding CKBaseTreeNode; this node holds the state of the component and its children nodes.
 If a component is an owner component, its children nodes (CKBaseTreeNode) will be attached to its corsponding node.
 Otherwise, they will be atatched to the same owner as the component itself.
 */

/*
 Return yes in case your component is the owner of its children components.
 Owner means that your component creates its children directly in its render method.

 For example:
 CKSingleChildComponent is an owner component.
 CKFlexboxComponent isn't; it receives its children as props in its constructor.

 Default values:
 CKSingleChildComponent returns YES
 CKGroupComponent returns NO
