/**
 CKCompositeComponent allows you to hide your implementation details and avoid subclassing layout components like
 CKFlexboxComponent. In almost all cases, you should subclass CKCompositeComponent instead of subclassing any other
 class directly.

 For example, suppose you create a component that should lay out some children in a vertical stack.
 Incorrect: subclass CKFlexboxComponent and call `self newWithChildren:`.
 Correct: subclass CKCompositeComponent and call `super newWithComponent:[CKFlexboxComponent newWithChildren...`

 This hides your layout implementation details from the outside world.

 @warning Overriding -layoutThatFits:parentSize: or -computeLayoutThatFits: is **not allowed** for any subclass.
