   Creates a CKComponentAnimation that applies a CAAnimation to a CKComponent, on the layer found at layerPath. The
   layer of the view is used when layerPath is nil.
   
   @note The CKComponent must create a UIView via its view configuration; or, it must be a CKCompositeComponent that
   renders to a component that creates a view. The view must have a CALayer at the keypath that corresponds to
   layerPath; or, it must be nil.

   @example Animate the position of a component: {myComponent, [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeypath:@"position"]}
   
   @example Suppose the component has a CAShapeLayer as the mask of the view's layer. The path of the mask could be
   animated with: {myComponent, [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeypath:@"path"], "layer.mask"}
   
   @param component A CKComponent that will be animated.
   @param animation A CAAnimation to apply on the component's layer.
   @param layerPath A key path to a sublayer of the component's view. Defaults to nil.
