/**
 This class is an implementation of a `UICollectionViewDataSource` that can be used along with components. For each set of changes (i.e insertion/deletion/update
 of items and/or insertion/deletion of sections) the datasource will compute asynchronously on a background thread the corresponding component trees and then
 apply the corresponding UI changes to the collection view leveraging automatically view reuse.
 
 Doing so this reverses the traditional approach for a `UICollectionViewDataSource`. Usually the controller layer will *tell* the `UICollectionView` to update and
 then the `UICollectionView` *ask* the datasource for the data. Here the model is  more Reactive, from an external prospective, the datasource is *told* what
 changes to apply and then *tell* the collection view to apply the corresponding changes.
