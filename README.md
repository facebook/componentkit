ComponentKit is a view framework for iOS that is heavily inspired by React. It takes a functional, declarative approach to building UI. It was built to power Facebook's News Feed and is now used throughout the Facebook iOS app.

### Quick start

ComponentKit is available on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).  Add the following to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ComponentKit', '~> 0.13'
```

To quickly try WildeGuess, the ComponentKit demo project:

```ruby
