ComponentKit is an Objective-C++ view framework for iOS that is heavily inspired by [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). 

ComponentKit takes a functional, declarative approach to building UI. It lets you focus on what your UI should look like, not the steps necessary to build it. It emphasizes a one-way data flow from _immutable models_ to _immutable components_ that describe how views should be configured. It does the heavy lifting of building a view hierarchy from this description.

The framework was built to power Facebook's News Feed and is now used throughout the Facebook app. We introduced ComponentKit at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/atscale2014">@Scale Conference</a> in September:

(Don't confuse ComponentKit with [React Native](https://code.facebook.com/videos/786462671439502/react-js-conf-2015-keynote-introducing-react-native-/), a framework for building apps in JavaScript.)
