Remember the analogy made in [Philosophy](philosophy.html): components are like a stencil. They are an immutable snapshot of how a view should be configured at a given moment in time.

Every time something changes, an entirely new component is created and the old one is thrown away. This means components are **short-lived**, and their lifecycle is not under your control.

But sometimes, you do need an object with a longer lifecycle. *Component controllers* fill that role:

- [Components can't be delegates](components-cant-be-delegates.html) because they are short-lived, but component controllers can be delegates.
- Network downloads take time to complete; the component may have been recreated by the time the download completes. The controller can handle the callback.
- You may need an object to own some other object that should have a long lifetime.

## Creating Controllers 

- Controllers are instantiated automatically by ComponentKit. Don't try to create them manually.
- Define a controller by simply creating a subclass of `CKComponentController` that has the same name as your component plus "Controller".
- Your component must have a <a href="scopes.html">`CKComponentScope`</a> to have a controller. (If you forget, you will get an assertion failure.)
- Any `CKComponentAction` methods handled by your component can also be handled by the controller.

## Controller Flow

1. The component controller is **created** with the first component.
2. When the component is updated, a new instance is generatedâ€¦
3. But the component controller stays the same.

## Communication between Component and Component Controller  

There is a only a one-way communication channel between the component and its component controller - you can only pass data off of a component to a component controller. A component has no reference its corresponding component controller. This is by design. 

To pass data from a component to its controller, expose a `@property` on the component in a class extension. The controller can read those properties in `didUpdateComponent`.
